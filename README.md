# Fitness Data Analysis: Bellabeat Case Study

## Overview
This repository hosts an R script dedicated to the analysis of fitness data from Bellabeat, a health-focused smart device company. The project involves loading, preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing data from various health metrics, including daily activity, calorie burn, sleep patterns, and heart rate. The goal is to draw insights that could enhance Bellabeat's product offerings and influence their marketing strategy.

## About the Analysis
- The R script begins with the **Prepare Phase**, where data from different CSV files is loaded and inspected for structure and quality.
- In the **Process Phase**, the data undergoes cleaning, including the removal of missing values and duplicates, and transforming date formats for time series analysis.
- The **Analysis Phase** includes:
  - Calculating average daily metrics for activity, sleep, and heart rate.
  - Correlation analysis between total steps and calorie burn.
  - Trend analysis, integrating sleep and activity data to identify correlations and patterns throughout the week.
- The **Visualization Phase** employs `ggplot2` to graphically represent the data and uncover trends over time.
- Finally, in the **Analysis and Modeling Phase**, the data is further explored with advanced analytics techniques, including categorization of activity levels, violin plots of sleep duration by activity level, and regression models to predict daily step counts.

## Results and Insights
- This project provided valuable insights into the correlation between physical activities and other health metrics.
- Key patterns and trends were identified, suggesting optimal times for activity and pointing out weekly variations in user habits.
